       This project is focused on developing a todo list app that provides a streamlined and intuitive interface for managing tasks and staying                  organized using React. We used Oauth2 to allow users to sign in using a google account as well as JSON web tokens and requireAuth middleware for          user authentication and authorization. Tasks and notes are stored in a MongoDB database as well as account settings.
